                        Honestly? I’d say <strong>Twitter/X</strong> but not in
                        the usual “memes and politics” way. I follow a bunch of
                        data science folks, AI researchers, and startup
                        founders. It’s kind of like a live feed of what’s
                        happening in the industry: new papers, tools,
                        frameworks, and even job trends. I also use
                        <strong>ArXiv-sanity</strong> sometimes to keep track of
                        the latest ML/AI papers. There’s something satisfying
                        about seeing a feed of curated papers rather than
                        digging through ArXiv manually. If I had to pick a
                        runner-up, it’d be
                        <strong>Towards Data Science</strong> on Medium—great
                        for tutorials, case studies, and seeing how other folks
                        tackle problems. Honestly, I’m curious—do you want me to

                        Ah, that’s a big one—especially in data science, where a
                        wrong assumption can mess up a whole model. I usually
                        approach it in layers:

                                    reputable tech blogs get more weight. Medium

                                    first—are they actually working in the
                                    field, or just parroting what they read?

                                one or two other sources saying the same thing.
                                Especially for frameworks or new techniques, I
                                look for GitHub repos, tutorials, or case
                                studies to back it up.

                                it on a small dataset or toy example myself.
                                Nothing beats running the code and seeing if it
                                actually behaves as described.

                                HackerNews, Reddit’s r/MachineLearning, and even
                                GitHub issues can reveal whether a library or
                                approach is genuinely solid—or if it’s just

                                        A paper might sound groundbreaking in
                                        the abstract, but once you dive in, it’s
                                        either incremental or impractical.

                                        I often have to test small experiments
                                        or read the code (if available) to see
                                        if the approach actually works before

                            can it be? There are tons of tutorials online.” So I
                            jumped in:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Watched a couple of YouTube tutorials.</li>
                            <li>
                                Read a Medium article claiming it would teach me

                                <strong>oversimplified the math</strong>, so I
                                didn’t understand why the training process
                                worked.

                                <strong>had outdated dependencies</strong>, so I
                                spent hours just trying to get it to run without

                            been following instructions blindly. What saved me
                            eventually was going back to the
                            <strong>original papers</strong>, reading slowly,
                            and testing tiny examples on toy datasets. That’s
                            when it clicked. Lesson learned: shortcuts are
                            tempting, but they don’t replace
                            <strong>foundational understanding</strong>,
                            especially in cutting-edge areas.

                                I like <strong>free access</strong> to
                                information. Ads are a fair trade-off if the
                                content is good.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Subscriptions feel like a wall—you’re forced to
                                pay before knowing if the article is really
                                valuable. That can be frustrating when you’re
                                just browsing trends or trying to learn quickly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ads are easy to ignore if they’re placed well,
                                but subscriptions
                                <strong>interrupt the learning flow</strong>,
                                which is the last thing you want when you’re
                                deep in a tutorial or research.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            That said, if the platform offered
                            <strong

                            that actually supports quality authors, I wouldn’t
                            hate that either. It’s more about
                            <strong>flexibility and access</strong> than
                            anything else.

                    <p class="question m-b-1">
                        Can you save your favourite articles in Medium?

                            Yep! Medium actually has a pretty straightforward
                            way to do that. You can
                            <strong>“clap” for articles</strong> to show
                            appreciation, but more importantly, you can
                            <strong>save articles to your reading list</strong>.
                            Here’s how I use it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Whenever I find something I want to revisit—like
                                a tutorial, case study, or insightful trend
                                analysis—I hit the
                                <strong>“Save” button</strong> at the bottom of
                                the article.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All saved articles go into
                                <strong>your personal reading list</strong>,
                                which you can access anytime, even offline if
                                you’re using the app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I also organize them by tags or topics in my
                                head—like “ML tutorials,” “data engineering,”
                                “AI trends”—so it’s easier to go back when I
                                want to focus on a specific area.
                            </li>

                            Honestly, it’s saved me a ton of time. Instead of
                            trying to remember which link was useful, I just
                            dump it in the list and trust I’ll find it later.

                                Honestly, it’s a mix of structured and chaotic.
                                I have a few go-to
                                sources—<strong>TechCrunch</strong>,
                                <strong>Hacker News</strong>, and
                                <strong>Product Hunt</strong> are on my daily
                                scroll list. I also keep an eye on
                                <strong>LinkedIn</strong> because people in my
                                network share some pretty niche stuff. Podcasts
                                like <em>Acquired</em> or
                                <em>Lenny’s Podcast</em> keep me in the loop
                                when I’m commuting.

                            But I’d say half the time, it’s
                            serendipitous—someone on our engineering team drops
                            a cool AI tool in Slack, or I stumble on a Twitter
                            thread that spirals into a 2-hour rabbit hole. It’s
                            not super organized, but I kind of like it that way;
                            it keeps things fresh.

                            If I had to rank them, it’s probably
                            <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and
                            <strong>Slack</strong> first, then

                                LinkedIn is weirdly good because a lot of PMs
                                and founders in my network are sharing early
                                thoughts, case studies, or cool product
                                launches. It’s like curated noise—still noisy,
                                but less random than Twitter.

                                Slack is where most of the gold happens. Our
                                internal channels have hardcore techies who drop
                                new frameworks or tools they’re experimenting
                                with, and it’s instantly relevant because it’s
                                coming from people I trust.

                                <strong>Overload</strong>. There’s just too much
                                content. LinkedIn’s feed can get spammy—everyone
                                wants to be a thought leader. Slack is great but
                                things disappear fast; if you miss a thread,
                                it’s buried. Product Hunt’s fun but not always
                                practical—you see a lot of hype without context.
                                Hacker News especially—it’s a mix of brilliant
                                insights and random hot takes.

                            platforms, bookmarks, saved posts, screenshots… It’s
                            messy. I wish there was one place to pull it all

                            I have a mix of structured and fast-scroll habits.
                            In the morning, I usually skim

                            pulse of the industry. During the day, I’m

                            <strong>Stack Overflow</strong>, internal docs, and
