                        What is the most useful app you use to keep yourself up

                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Honestly? I’d say **Twitter/X**—but not in the usual
                        “memes and politics” way. I follow a bunch of data
                        science folks, AI researchers, and startup founders.
                        It’s kind of like a live feed of what’s happening in the
                        industry: new papers, tools, frameworks, and even job
                        trends. I also use **ArXiv-sanity** sometimes to keep
                        track of the latest ML/AI papers. There’s something
                        satisfying about seeing a feed of curated papers rather
                        than digging through ArXiv manually. If I had to pick a
                        runner-up, it’d be **Towards Data Science** on
                        Medium—great for tutorials, case studies, and seeing how
                        other folks tackle problems. Honestly, I’m curious—do
                        you want me to get into **how I actually schedule my
                        “industry catch-up” time** too? That’s where I think a
                        lot of people struggle.
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        So how do you trust the articles or information you
                        found online?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Ah, that’s a big one—especially in data science, where a
                        wrong assumption can mess up a whole model. I usually
                        approach it in layers: 1. **Source credibility:** I
                        check who’s publishing it. Peer-reviewed papers,
                        recognized data scientists, or reputable tech blogs get
                        more weight. Medium articles? I skim the author’s
                        background first—are they actually working in the field,
                        or just parroting what they read? 2.
                        **Cross-referencing:** If I see something interesting, I
                        try to find at least one or two other sources saying the
                        same thing. Especially for frameworks or new techniques,
                        I look for GitHub repos, tutorials, or case studies to
                        back it up. 3. **Hands-on verification:** This is my
                        favorite part. If a claim seems useful, I try it on a
                        small dataset or toy example myself. Nothing beats
                        running the code and seeing if it actually behaves as
                        described. 4. **Community signals:** For some things,
                        the “wisdom of the crowd” helps. HackerNews, Reddit’s
                        r/MachineLearning, and even GitHub issues can reveal
                        whether a library or approach is genuinely solid—or if
                        it’s just hype. Honestly, I think being skeptical is
                        half the job. If something sounds too good to be true, I
                        treat it as experimental until proven otherwise. If you
                        want, I can give a **real example of how I tested an
                        article or framework before trusting it**—it’s kind of
                        funny, actually. Want me to?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        what's the missing app you really want to have but it
                        doesn't exist right now?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Oh, this one’s fun—I’ve thought about it a lot. I’d love
                        an app that’s like a **personalized, interactive
                        “industry radar” for data science and AI.”** Here’s what
                        I mean: * It would pull from papers, blogs, GitHub
                        repos, podcasts, and even tweets. * Then it would
                        **summarize the key trends** for me, like “Graph Neural
                        Networks are trending in recommender systems” or “New
                        Python library just released for time series
                        forecasting.” * I’d want it to **rank stuff by relevance
                        to my projects** or skill level, so I’m not drowning in
                        noise. * Bonus points: it could generate
                        **mini-experiments or code snippets** to try new
                        techniques straight from the feed—like a “hands-on trend
                        tester.” Basically, it’d save hours of scrolling and
                        give me a real-time, practical view of what matters in
                        the industry, not just what’s popular. Honestly, if
                        someone built this, I’d pay for it in a heartbeat. If
                        you want, I can sketch out **how I’d personally use it
                        day-to-day**—it’s kind of revealing about how I
                        structure my learning. Do you want me to?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        what are the difficulties you have to get the trends
                        from Twitter/X or ArXiv-sanity like you said?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Oh, there are definitely some headaches—both platforms
                        are super useful, but they’re not exactly
                        “plug-and-play” for keeping up with trends.
                        **Twitter/X:** * **Noise:** There’s a lot of hype and
                        opinions mixed in with actual insights. You have to sift
                        through tweets to find the genuinely useful content. *
                        **Echo chambers:** If you follow only certain people,
                        you can miss alternative approaches or criticisms. I’ve
                        caught myself thinking “everyone is using this new
                        library” when it’s really just my feed. *
                        **Fast-moving:** A really important thread can get
                        buried in hours, and sometimes threads are split across
                        multiple tweets—so it’s easy to miss context.
                        **ArXiv-sanity:** * **Overload:** There are *so many
                        papers* every day. Even with filters, you can still get
                        dozens that seem interesting but are only tangentially
                        relevant. * **Abstracts can be misleading:** A paper
                        might sound groundbreaking in the abstract, but once you
                        dive in, it’s either incremental or impractical. *
                        **Requires manual verification:** I often have to test
                        small experiments or read the code (if available) to see
                        if the approach actually works before trusting it.
                        Honestly, both are amazing tools, but they **require
                        time and critical thinking**. That’s why I keep thinking
                        about this “personalized trend radar” app—it’d cut
                        through a lot of this noise automatically. If you want,
                        I can give a **concrete example of a trend I almost
                        missed because of these difficulties**—it’s a bit of a
                        cautionary tale. Want me to share it?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">
                        Tell me about a time you try to learn some industry
                        knowledge online, but you failed to do so. What
                        happened?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Oh, I’ve got a perfect example—it still makes me cringe
                        a little. A few months back, I wanted to get up to speed
                        on **diffusion models for image generation**. They were
                        all the rage, and I figured, “How hard can it be? There
                        are tons of tutorials online.” So I jumped in: 1.
                        Watched a couple of YouTube tutorials. 2. Read a Medium
                        article claiming it would teach me everything in “30
                        minutes.” 3. Grabbed a GitHub repo linked in the
                        article. At first, I thought I was making progress—but
                        then: * The Medium article **oversimplified the math**,
                        so I didn’t understand why the training process worked.
                        * The YouTube tutorial **skipped over key steps**, like
                        pre-processing the dataset properly. * The GitHub repo
                        **had outdated dependencies**, so I spent hours just
                        trying to get it to run without errors. After a whole
                        weekend, I realized I had **more frustration than
                        understanding**. I hadn’t actually learned the concepts;
                        I’d just been following instructions blindly. What saved
                        me eventually was going back to the **original papers**,
                        reading slowly, and testing tiny examples on toy
                        datasets. That’s when it clicked. Lesson learned:
                        shortcuts are tempting, but they don’t replace
                        **foundational understanding**, especially in
                        cutting-edge areas. If you want, I can share the
                        **specific approach I took after that failure to make
                        sure I really learned it**, which actually worked pretty
                        well. Do you want me to go into that?
                    </div>
                    <p class="question">So what do you think about Medium?</p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Medium? Honestly, it’s a mixed bag for me. **The good:**
                        * There are some really solid articles and tutorials,
                        especially from people who are actually working in the
                        field. It’s a great way to see **practical, hands-on
                        experiences**, case studies, or unconventional
                        approaches you won’t find in papers. * I like that it’s
                        **digestible**. You can cover a topic in 15–30 minutes,
                        which is perfect when you just want to get a sense of a
                        new trend or tool. **The bad:** * Quality is **very
                        inconsistent**. Some articles are gold; others are just
                        someone repeating buzzwords or regurgitating what’s
                        already online. * Sometimes authors **oversimplify
                        complex concepts**, which can give a false sense of
                        understanding—this has tripped me up before. * It’s also
                        **SEO-driven**, so the posts that get most visibility
                        aren’t always the most accurate or helpful. I use it
                        selectively. I usually check the author’s background and
                        cross-reference with papers, GitHub repos, or forums
                        before taking anything as reliable. Honestly, I think
                        Medium is like a snack—good for quick bites of
                        knowledge—but if you want a full meal, you need to go
                        deeper. If you want, I can tell you **how I personally
                        filter Medium articles so I don’t waste time on the
                        fluff**. That method actually saves a lot of
                        frustration.

                    <p class="question">
                        what feature you dislike the most of Medium?

                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Oh, without a doubt, it’s the **paywall and gating of
                        content**. Here’s why it frustrates me: * Sometimes an
                        article looks super promising, but you hit the paywall
                        after a few paragraphs. Sure, they want to monetize, but
                        it **breaks the flow of learning**. * It encourages
                        **clickbait-style titles**—authors know the first few
                        lines need to hook you before you hit the limit, so some
                        content feels more like marketing than teaching. * Even
                        worse, some high-quality tutorials or case studies are
                        **hidden behind Medium’s subscription**, while less
                        valuable content is free. It’s a bit random. I end up
                        either looking for mirrors of the same content elsewhere
                        or giving up on the article entirely. It makes the
                        platform feel a little inconsistent in terms of
                        accessibility for learning. If you want, I can share the
                        **one workaround I use to still get value from Medium
                        without paying for everything**—it’s kind of a life hack
                        for data science reading.

                    <p class="question">
                        so do you prefer viewing advertisement than subscription
                        ?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Yeah, honestly, I’d take ads over a subscription any
                        day—**as long as they’re not obnoxious pop-ups**. Here’s
                        why: * I like **free access** to information. Ads are a
                        fair trade-off if the content is good. * Subscriptions
                        feel like a wall—you’re forced to pay before knowing if
                        the article is really valuable. That can be frustrating
                        when you’re just browsing trends or trying to learn
                        quickly. * Ads are easy to ignore if they’re placed
                        well, but subscriptions **interrupt the learning flow**,
                        which is the last thing you want when you’re deep in a
                        tutorial or research. That said, if the platform offered
                        **a clean, ad-free experience with a small
                        subscription** that actually supports quality authors, I
                        wouldn’t hate that either. It’s more about **flexibility
                        and access** than anything else. If you want, I can tell
                        you **how I usually balance free and paid content to
                        stay up-to-date without spending a fortune**—I’ve got a
                        pretty efficient system.

                    <p class="question">
                        can you save your favourite articles in Medium?
                    </p>
                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        Yep! Medium actually has a pretty straightforward way to
                        do that. You can **“clap” for articles** to show
                        appreciation, but more importantly, you can **save
                        articles to your reading list**. Here’s how I use it: *
                        Whenever I find something I want to revisit—like a
                        tutorial, case study, or insightful trend analysis—I hit
                        the **“Save” button** at the bottom of the article. *
                        All saved articles go into **your personal reading
                        list**, which you can access anytime, even offline if
                        you’re using the app. * I also organize them by tags or
                        topics in my head—like “ML tutorials,” “data
                        engineering,” “AI trends”—so it’s easier to go back when
                        I want to focus on a specific area. Honestly, it’s saved
                        me a ton of time. Instead of trying to remember which
                        link was useful, I just dump it in the list and trust
                        I’ll find it later. If you want, I can tell you **my
                        trick for combining Medium saves with other tools to
                        build a personal “knowledge dashboard”**—it’s super
                        handy for a data scientist.
