                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1"
                        >social cohesion</span
                    >
                    by empowering diverse communities to
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 1"
                        >share their stories</span
                    >,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 2"
                        >connect with others</span
                    >, and
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 3"
                        >access resources that enhance their visibility and
                        influence</span
                    >. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by creating
                    platforms that celebrate and support the unique identities
                    of communities across Australia.

                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI’s mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 4"
                        >celebrate and support the unique identities of
                        communities across Australia</span
                    >.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 8"
                        >dynamic, user-friendly</span
                    >
                    websites that <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 5"
                        >represent and support different communities</span>.
                    Each website should serve as a
                    central hub where community members can share
                        resources, highlight events, and foster meaningful
                        connections</span
                    >. The websites must not include any form of commercial
                    activity, such as advertising or selling products. However,
                    it is acceptable to promote resources, events, or services
                    that are directly beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 9"
                        >accessible, mobile-friendly</span
                    >, and reflect the diverse
                        needs of the selected community focus area
                    while adhering to our mission of
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >inclusivity</span
                    >,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3"
                        >accessibility</span
                    >, and ethical design. Each website should also celebrate
                    the unique characteristics of its chosen community and
                    support <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Card 6"
                        >meaningful interaction and engagement</span>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected

                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the
                        website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.

                            diversity within the community rather than relying
