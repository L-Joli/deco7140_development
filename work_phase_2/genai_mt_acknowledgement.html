                <h2>How GenAI Was Used</h2>
                <p>
                    I used ChatGPT in multiple ways throughout this assignment
                    to support both the research and design process. I conducted
                    interviews with the AI to practice user research, which
                    allowed me to explore how a user might respond to various
                    concerns. After identifying the client’s values, I
                    brainstormed potential features with ChatGPT, helping me
                    expand and refine my ideas. During development, I asked
                    ChatGPT to generate an HTML template for presenting my data
                    and to refine my web design style. Additionally, I used it
                    for grammar checking, generating a reset.css file, creating
                    a navigation bar, improving accessibility, and developing
                    helper CSS classes.
                </p>

                <h2>How GenAI Supported Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Using ChatGPT supported my learning in several ways. It
                    helped me understand concepts more clearly, particularly in
                    phrasing questions for user research, which allowed me to
                    expand my ideas and thoughts. It also sped up my web
                    development and design process, giving me more time to focus
                    on learning new concepts. Through AI assistance, I
                    discovered new approaches for addressing accessibility
                    requirements on a web page and explored techniques for
                    improving usability. Additionally, asking ChatGPT for
                    clarification on client values and user needs strengthened
                    my understanding and confidence in applying these concepts
                    effectively.
                </p>

                <h2>GenAI’s Effectiveness</h2>
                <p>
                    ChatGPT was most helpful for styling HTML and addressing
                    accessibility requirements. However, some style fine-tuning
                    suggestions didn’t work as expected, so I often needed to
                    adjust the results myself. Even when it provided code, I had
                    to double-check its output to ensure it didn’t
                    unintentionally alter my ideas or wording. Overall, ChatGPT
                    enhanced my thinking, particularly during brainstorming, by
                    allowing me to explore ideas independently and ask follow-up
                    questions to clarify concepts. At times, if my prompts were
                    not specific enough, the AI struggled to understand my
                    requirements, such as for creating the navigation bar, so I
                    needed to iterate multiple times and make manual
                    adjustments.
                </p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    I made sure to clearly distinguish my own ideas from AI
                    suggestions and kept track of all usage in a GenAI
                    acknowledgment form. I double-checked the AI’s contributions
                    to ensure it did not unintentionally alter my ideas, and I
                    used Git to monitor changes. To maintain accuracy and
                    responsibility, I tested the usability of AI-generated code
                    and cross-referenced suggestions with official
                    documentation. Finally, I ensured that my use of ChatGPT
                    aligned with academic guidelines by using it as a supportive
                    tool rather than a replacement for my own thinking, making
                    sure all final decisions and ideas were my own.
