                        <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the A3 Design Proposal, I utilised both
                            Gemini and ChatGPT to support various stages of the
                            design and development process. The primary purpose
                            was to use these tools as dialogue partners to
                            refine design concepts, accelerate front-end coding,
                            and improve the clarity of written content. My goal
                            was to leverage GenAI for brainstorming and
                            implementation efficiency, allowing more time to
                            focus on the strategic and ethical dimensions of the
                            design work, rather than using it to replace my own
                            critical thinking.
                        </p>

                    <div class="reflection-card">
                        <h3>Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
                        <p>
                            I maintained ownership by treating GenAI outputs as
                            starting points for further refinement. For
                            instance, when using Gemini to redesign HTML
                            sections, I critically evaluated the generated code
                            structure and styling. While the initial layout was
                            a useful foundation, I made significant
                            modifications to ensure the design aligned with the
                            project's specific aesthetic and accessibility
                            requirements. Similarly, when ChatGPT suggested
                            homepage content, I rewrote them to fit my
                            narrative, ensuring the final voice was my own. I
                            rejected any code or text that did not directly
                            serve the project's goals or my design intent.

                        <h3>Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
                        <p>
                            To ensure accuracy, all code generated by GenAI
                            tools was tested for functionality. When I prompted
                            for a color palette, I checked the functionality and
                            the readability. I was aware that GenAI can produce
                            generic content, so I actively refined text
                            suggestions to be specific to the TechHub community,
                            ensuring an inclusive tone that aligns with the
                            client's mission.

                            proprietary details from the project briefs were
                            ever used in my prompts. All queries were
                            generalised to focus on design principles, coding
                            techniques, or content ideas without disclosing
                            confidential project context.

                        <p>
                            Using GenAI tools significantly supported my
                            learning by accelerating the more routine aspects of
                            web development, such as boilerplate CSS and HTML.
                            This efficiency gave me more cognitive space to
                            engage deeply with UX principles, ethical
                            frameworks, and accessibility standards. The process
                            of prompting and refining also sharpened my ability
                            to articulate design requirements clearly. I found
                            that critically evaluating AI suggestions,
                            identifying their strengths and weaknesses, was a
                            powerful learning exercise in itself, reinforcing my
                            understanding of what constitutes good design.

                            I have used GenAI tools as a supportive element in
                            my design and development workflow. All outputs were
                            critically reviewed and edited. I maintained full
                            control over all final design decisions, and the
                            submitted work is a product of my own thinking,
                            analysis, and creative judgment.
